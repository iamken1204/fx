fx is a coding agent CLI written in Zig: a 6.17 MiB native binary that is open source (Apache-2.0), model-agnostic, and embeddable as a harness in larger systems. Its interface stays closer to a Unix shell than an IDE in the terminal.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fx.sh/setup.sh | bash
```

## Get started

Sign in with one of:

- `fx login`: Vercel AI Gateway
- `fx login codex`: ChatGPT subscription (OpenAI Codex OAuth)
- `fx login grok`: Grok subscription (xAI OAuth)
- `fx setup`: AI Gateway API key

Then start the interactive shell from a project:

```bash
cd your_project
fx
```

Or make a one-shot request:

```bash
fx ask "explain the changes in this repository"
```

Inside the shell, run `/help` to browse interactive commands.

## Embed fx

fx builds as a native binary or WebAssembly. Applications embedding fx can provide network transport, session storage, configuration, permission handling, and terminal I/O.

| Surface | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `fx acp` | Connect the native agent to editors and other Agent Client Protocol clients. |
| `createFxAgent()` | Embed the agent core in a JavaScript host with `fx-core.wasm`. |
| `createFxTerminal()` | Embed the interactive terminal with `fx-term.wasm`. |

The WebAssembly SDK is experimental. See the [WebAssembly SDK](sdk/README.md) and [ACP documentation](https://fx.sh/docs/using-fx/acp).

The SDK is published to npm as [libfx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libfx). For runnable Node.js, browser, Next.js, and Nuxt applications, see the [libfx examples](examples/README.md).

## Extend fx

Replace the compiled system prompt for every session by writing your own to `~/.fx/SYSTEM.md`:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.fx/SYSTEM.md
```

The file applies to the interactive TUI, `fx ask`, `fx acp`, and subagents. `fx ask --system` still overrides it for a single request, and `~/.fx/AGENTS.md` keeps adding instructions to the prompt instead of replacing it. fx keeps the compiled prompt when the file is missing, blank, larger than 64 KiB, symlinked, or not valid UTF-8. Run `fx doctor` to see which prompt is active and why a file was refused.

- [Skills](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/skills): reusable instructions the agent loads when invoked
- [MCP](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/mcp): connect external tools and servers
- [Subagents](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/subagents): delegate independent work

## Documentation

Read the [fx documentation](https://fx.sh/docs) for sessions, models, permissions, configuration, and the full CLI and slash command references.

## Build from source

Building fx requires [Zig 0.16.0+](https://ziglang.org/download/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx.git
cd fx
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
./zig-out/bin/fx
```

Run the test suite with `zig build test`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and contribution guidelines.
